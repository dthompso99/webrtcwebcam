webrtcwebcam
============

A very simple, but functional, example of a video chat application utilizing webRTC.  Currently only functional in chrome and chrome frame.

Installation
============
While 90% of the work is done on the client (webRTC is peer to peer), a server is still neccissary to coordinate the connection.  In this example, Im using a VERY simple nodejs server that is essentially acting as a simple broadcast echo server.
